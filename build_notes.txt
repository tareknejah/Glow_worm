  - This is collection of notes on architecture issues and compilation
    requirements to get the Glow Worm framework to function in the 
    Arduino build system.

1.  Blocks extend the gw::Node class and are the primary building blocks
    for autonomous systems under the Glow Worm Framework.  Most blocks
    are a header only file that fully inlines the functionality of the 
    block.

2.  More advanced blocks like scanner.h require a .cpp file to implement
    their functionality.  Unfortunately, the Arduino build system won't
    find the .cpp file in the blocks subdirectory.  Therefore the 
    .cpp files are located in the top level Glow_worm library folder.
    Although this clutters the main library folder it is required for the
    linker to find the function definitions.  The error messages associated
    with this linker failure look something like the following:
         .cpp.o: In function 'loop':
	 undefined reference to 'Scanner_5pt::run()'
	 
3.	The use of const Cmd_velocity_msg's as control vectors results
	in the compiler creating a temporary instance of the Message class
	then discarding the temporary after it stores the constant Message
	into flash memory.  This is what I think explains the higher than
	expected counts of messages when ch.list() is run on bots like
	whisker_bot.
